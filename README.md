Array language for math

WIP, but hopefully will include some of the core BQN features plus modular arithmetic, and
a way to pattern match on a number mod n, plus exhaustive pattern guarantees.
Will use Lisp syntax for now, but only monads or dyads.

Also would like something like `*args` in python, but the `*` determines what level to map at in a sense
